Passwordless Biometric Authentication System 🔐

What the Project Does
         This project implements a secure authentication system that removes the need for traditional passwords.
Instead of usernames and passwords, users are authenticated using biometric data such as face recognition, voice, or other biometric features.
The goal is to improve security, reduce password-related attacks, and simplify the login process.

Features
Passwordless user authentication
Biometric-based registration and login
Improved security against phishing and brute-force attacks
Faster and user-friendly authentication process
Scalable system design

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Machine Learning libraries
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Version Control: Git, GitHub
